            <div class="faq-question">Q: How is toxicity of water wastage tested with aquatic animals?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: Toxicity of chemicals in water can be tested with aquatic animals as indicators. Toxicity tests with aquatic animals are mainly concerned with direct uptake from water. The chemicals may be in solution, in suspension or both.
To determine values for lethal concentrations organisms are exposed to different concentrations. When an effect occurs the effect-concentration of the chemical is noted. When the test-animal dies the lethal concentration is noted. This way the toxicity of a chemical is determined in a laboratory. When many of the test animals die at low concentrations of a chemical it means that the chemical in question is very toxic. When we know how toxic a chemical is, we also know the effects of this chemical when a certain concentration is present at a location.</div>

            <div class="faq-question">Q: Are there any steps taken by the government regarding water wastage?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) / Pollution Control Committees(PPCs) is monitoring the quality of water bodies at 2500 locations across the country under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWQMP) which indicate that organic pollution is the predominant cause of water pollution. Based on the magnitude of organic pollution, CPCB in 2008 identified 150 polluted river stretches which increased to 302 in 2015. The rivers stretches are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated / partially treated sewage and discharge of industrial wastewater. CPCB assessed the total volume of municipal wastewater generation in the country at about 61,948 MLD as against the installed sewage treatment capacity of 23,277 MLD leaving a wide gap of more than 38,671 MLD. Similar observations were made by WHO in its reports on water pollution.
			<br></br>

The steps taken by the Government to address the issues of water pollution include the following:-
<br></br>

i. Preparation of action plan for sewage management and restoration of water quality in aquatic resources by State Governments;
<br></br>
ii. Installation of Online Effluent Monitoring System to check the discharge of effluent directly into the rivers and water bodies;
<br></br>
iii. Setting up of monitoring network for assessment of water quality;
<br></br>
iv. Action to comply with effluent standards is taken by SPCBs / PCCs to improve the water quality of the rivers;
<br></br>
v. Financial assistance for installation of Common Effluent Treatment Plants for cluster of Small Scale Industrial units;
<br></br>
vi. Issuance of directions for implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge;
<br></br>
vii. Issuance of directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to industries and under Section 18(1)(b) of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974;
<br></br>
viii. Implementation of National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) and National Wetland Conservation Programme (NWCP) for conservation and management of identified lakes and wetlands in the country which have been merged in February, 2013 into an integrated scheme of National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) to undertake various conservation activities including interception, diversion and treatment of waste water, pollution abatement, lake beautification, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation etc.

            <div class="faq-question">Q: What are the main sources of water pollution?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: The main point source of pollution to water is from sewage and waste water treatment, while for diffuse pollution, main sources are from farming and fossil fuel power plants (via the air).
