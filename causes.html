        <h2>Main causes of water wastage</h2>
        <p>It is sometimes caused by nature, such as when mercury filters from the Earth's crust, polluting oceans, rivers, lakes, canals and reservoirs. However, the most common cause of poor quality water is human activity and its consequences, which we will now go on to explain:</p>
        <h2><img src="gw.jpg" alt="gw"> Global Warming</h2>
		<p>Global warming causes water temperatures to rise, which can kill water-dwelling animals. When large die-offs occur, it further pollutes the water supply, exacerbating the issue. There are many everyday ways you can help reduce global warming, which will in turn help lower water pollution.</p>
		<h2><img src="d.jpg" alt="d"> Deforestation</h2>
		<p>In the absence of tree cover, there is nothing to hold the soil cover. The decrease of forest area increases the rate of soil erosion, resulting in higher sediment flux and turbidity in water. This leads to lower water quality and increased costs associated with drinking water treatment.</p>
		<h2><img src="a.jpg" alt="a"> Industry, agriculture and livestock farming</h2>
		<p>Chemical dumping from these sectors is one of the main causes of eutrophication of water.</p>
		<h2><img src="s.png" alt="s"> Rubbish and faecal water dumping</h2>
        <p>Human activities that generate domestic sewage and toxic waste cause water wastage by contaminating water with disease-causing microorganisms and poisonous substances. Oil spills are another source of water pollution that have devastating impacts on surrounding ecosystems.</p>
		<h2><img src="m.png" alt="m"> Maritime traffic</h2>
        <p>Much of the plastic pollution in the ocean comes from fishing boats, tankers and cargo shipping.Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship. A large cruise ship (3,000 passengers and crew) generates an estimated 55,000 to 110,000 liters per day of blackwater waste.</p>
		<h2><img src="f.png" alt="p"> Fuel spillages</h2>
		<p>An oil spill can block the sunlight that plants need for photosynthesis, which kills plants growing in the water. Oil spills can result in closed beaches and harbours. Oil pollution affects fishing and hunting, which is especially detrimental for people who rely on hunting and fishing, such as many rural communities.</p>
